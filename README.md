autotarget* is an ongoing project aimed at developing an innovative drone swarm framework that offers maximum flexibility and interoperability with different types of swarm drones. These drones are equipped with on-board sensors and payloads. The design and manufacture of the drones and on-board sensors are carried out in-house at our DroneLab.

This framework aims to embed intelligence and facilitate the development of collaborative applications designed to operate in a distributed way and on a fleet of drones flying simultaneously. This enables us to rapidly carry out exploratory missions while collecting large quantities of multisource data, such as hyperspectral cameras in the visible, near infrared and short infrared, infrared thermal cameras, magnetometers, radiometers and Lidar sensors. We also develop and test new drone concepts, and share some of our drone systems as open hardware.
